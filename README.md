# Introduction to Programming (22 November 2017)
All of the materials used in the workshop are contained in the zip file.

When unzipped it should have the same folder structure as we used in the workshop

If you do not extract it directly to the c drive, you will have to change the path to the data files in the codes examples which refer to files.
